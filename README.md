A public repository by Fatcat where we show our System architecture, Development strategies etc.  
Fatcat is built on a Microservices architecture to enable Continous Integration and Continous Deployment workflows.  
All our services are containerized with Docker and managed through Kubernetes.  
We deploy our containers on AWS Cloud and also our datacenters are INDIA CENTRAL Zone.  
All our services are loosely coupled thus independently deployable.  

This is our Architecture Diagram:
